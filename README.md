## Introduction
**Cub3D** is a 42 project inspired by classic FPS games like Wolfenstein 3D. The goal is to build a 3D rendering engine using raycasting, implementing core gameplay mechanics, and creating an immersive maze exploration experience. This project tests your understanding of graphical programming, 3D mathematics, and efficient memory management.

## Mandatory Part

### Overview
The mandatory part of the project requires you to:
- Render a 3D view of a maze using raycasting.
- Handle player movements and collisions.
- Parse a `.cub` map file containing the maze's configuration.

### Gameplay
- The player can move in four directions (forward, backward, left, right) and rotate their view.
- Walls, floors, and ceilings are rendered based on the map file.
- The game ends when the player reaches a designated exit.

### Compilation and Execution
To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
make
```

To run the game, execute:

```bash
./cub3D map.cub
```

Here, `map.cub` is a valid map file adhering to the project specifications.

## Bonus Part

### Bonus Overview
The bonus part expands the basic game engine by introducing new interactive and visual features, enhancing the gameplay experience.

### Features
1. **Minimap:**
   - A dynamic minimap displays the playerâ€™s position and surroundings for easier navigation.
2. **Interactive Doors:**
   - Doors can be opened by pressing the spacebar if the player is close enough.
   - Doors close automatically when the player moves far enough away.
3. **Animations:**
   - Animations run smoothly at 24 frames per second (FPS) to enhance the visual appeal.
4. **Background Music:**
   - Two songs are integrated:
     - The first plays at the beginning of the game.
     - The second is triggered when the player passes through a door.

### Compilation and Execution
To compile the bonus version, use:

```bash
make bonus
```

Run the game with:

```bash
./cub3D_bonus map.cub
```
